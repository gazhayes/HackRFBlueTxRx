You will need to create your own WAV (PCM) audio file sampled at 48kHz. This is critical - if you don't pay attention to the sample rate your audio will sound distorted or too fast.

If you are transmitting at the frequency I set (51 MHz) the actual transmit frequency where you will find your transmit audio in AM, LSB, USB, or CW will be the following:
AM: 51.117 MHz
LSB: 51.121 MHz
USB: 51.121 MHz
CW: 51.137 MHz

If at first you don't find the transmit signal with another radio, just tune +/- 10kHz until you hear the audio being transmitted and then you'll be there.
